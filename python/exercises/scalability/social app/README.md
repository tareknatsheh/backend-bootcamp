The platform allow users to post messages, follow other users, and view a timeline of posts from users they follow. However, the initial implementation of the platform is inefficient, causing performance issues as the user base grows.

2. Posting Messages: Allow registered users to post messages.
3. Following Users: Allow users to follow other users.
4. Timeline: Provide each user with a timeline of posts from users they follow.

python main.py
